Create a real-time chat application backend with AI responses. The app should:
- Allow creating users with names
- Support multiple chat channels
- Enable users to send messages to channels
- Automatically generate AI responses to user messages
- Show recent message history

The backend should provide APIs for:
1. User management (creation)
2. Channel management (creation)
3. Message operations (sending, listing)
4. AI response generation using OpenAI's GPT-4

Messages should be stored with their channel, author, and content. The system should maintain message order
and limit history display to the 10 most recent messages per channel.
