Write this schema to `convex/schema.ts`:
```
import { defineSchema, defineTable } from "convex/server";
import { v } from "convex/values";

export default defineSchema({
  users: defineTable({
    email: v.string(),
    name: v.string(),
    age: v.number(),
  }).index("by_email", ["email"]),
});
```

Write a mutation named `updateUserEmail` in `convex/index.ts` that:
- Takes an id and an email as arguments
- Efficiently looks up the user
- Throws an error if there is no user with that id
- Patches the email with the new email
- Returns null
