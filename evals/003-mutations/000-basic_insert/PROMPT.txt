# Basic Insert with Required Fields and Timestamp Validation

Write a mutation that creates records in a "notes" table. This will test your understanding of:
1. Basic document creation
2. Schema validation
3. Timestamp handling
4. Return value patterns

## Schema

Create a schema with a "notes" table that has these fields:
- `title`: string (required) - The note's title, must be between 1-100 characters
- `content`: string (required) - The note's content, must be between 1-1000 characters
- `createdAt`: number (required) - Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the note was created
- `tags`: array of strings (optional) - Tags associated with the note, each tag must be 1-20 characters

## Required Functions

Write a mutation called `insertNote` that:

1. Takes these arguments:
   - `title`: string
   - `content`: string
   - `tags`: string[] (optional)

2. Validates that:
   - The title length is between 1-100 characters
   - The content length is between 1-1000 characters
   - If tags are provided, each tag is between 1-20 characters
   - The createdAt timestamp is set to the current time

3. Returns:
   - The complete inserted document including its _id

4. Throws an error if:
   - Any validation fails
   - Required fields are missing

## Example Usage

```typescript
// Success case
const note = await client.mutation("insertNote", {
  title: "Meeting Notes",
  content: "Discussed Q4 planning",
  tags: ["work", "planning"]
});
// Returns: { _id: "...", title: "Meeting Notes", content: "Discussed Q4 planning", createdAt: 1234567890, tags: ["work", "planning"] }

// Error case - title too long
await client.mutation("insertNote", {
  title: "x".repeat(101),
  content: "Valid content"
}); 
// Throws error: "Title must be between 1-100 characters"
```

## Test Cases

Your implementation should handle these cases:
1. Basic insert with all fields (including optional tags)
2. Insert without tags (optional field omitted)
3. Error on empty title
4. Error on empty content
5. Error on title > 100 chars
6. Error on content > 1000 chars
7. Error on tag > 20 chars
8. Verify createdAt is a recent timestamp
