Create a backend for a course enrollment system where:

1. Students can be enrolled in multiple courses
2. Courses can have multiple students enrolled
3. We need to track both:
   - All courses a student is enrolled in
   - All students enrolled in a course
4. For each enrollment, we also want to track:
   - The enrollment date
   - The student's final grade (if completed)

Requirements:
- Design the schema to efficiently support these queries:
  - List all courses a student is enrolled in
  - List all students enrolled in a course
  - Find all students who got an A in any course
  - Find all courses where a student got an A
- Use appropriate indexes to ensure optimal query performance
- Include example queries demonstrating how to efficiently retrieve this data

Only write the `schema.ts` file.
