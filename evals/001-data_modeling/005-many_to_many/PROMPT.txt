Create a backend for a course enrollment system where:

1. Students can be enrolled in multiple courses
2. Courses can have multiple students enrolled
3. We need to track both:
   - All courses a student is enrolled in
   - All students enrolled in a course
4. For each enrollment, we also want to track:
   - The enrollment date, represented as a number (Unix timestamp)
   - The student's final grade (if completed), represented as an optional string

Requirements:
- Design the schema to efficiently support these queries with indexes:
  - List all courses a student is enrolled in
  - List all students enrolled in a course  

Only write the `schema.ts` file.
