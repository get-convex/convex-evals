Create a backend for a course enrollment system where:

1. Students have a name and email
2. Students can be enrolled in multiple courses
3. Courses can have multiple students enrolled
4. Course have the following metadata:
   - name (string)
   - code (string)
   - description (string)
5. We need to track both:
   - All courses a student is enrolled in
   - All students enrolled in a course
6. For each enrollment, we also want to track:
   - The enrollment date, represented as a number (Unix timestamp)
   - The student's grade (if completed), represented as an optional string

Requirements:
- Design the schema to efficiently support these queries with indexes:
  - List a subset of courses a student is enrolled in based on a filter condition (for example: What are the courses that student A is enrolled in that aren't class A or class B?)
  - List a subset students enrolled in a course based on a filter condition (for example: Who are the students in class A that aren't student A or student B?)

Only create the `package.json` and `convex/schema.ts` files. Do NOT create any functions.
