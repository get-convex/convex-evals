Create a schema file that has a single table `messages` with:
1. content: string
2. author_email: string
3. sent_at: number

Add an index so I can efficiently query all of the messages for a given author that were
sent in a given time range.

Only create the `convex/schema.ts` file. Do NOT create any functions.
