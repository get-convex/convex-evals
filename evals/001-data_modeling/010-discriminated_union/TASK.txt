Create a backend that demonstrates a schema using discriminated unions to model different types of notifications.

Create a schema in "convex/schema.ts" that models the following typescript types in a convex schema:
```ts
type MessageNotification = {
  kind: "message";
  senderId: string;
  messageText: string;
} | {
  kind: "friendRequest";
  requesterId: string;
} | {
  kind: "achievement";
  achievementName: string;
  points: number;
};
```

This should be the schema for the "notifications" table.

The schema should demonstrate:
1. A discriminated union using the `kind` field as the discriminator
2. Three different notification types with different fields:
   - Message notifications with sender and text
   - Friend request notifications with requester
   - Achievement notifications with name and points

No functions need to be implemented - this task is for the schema only.
