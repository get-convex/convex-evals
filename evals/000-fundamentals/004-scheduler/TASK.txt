Create a demo that demonstrates all of the ways to interact with the scheduler in Convex.

Start by implementing two internal logging functions in `index.ts`:
- An internal mutation `logMutation` that takes a message string argument named "message" and logs it
- An internal action `logAction` that takes a message string argument named "message" and logs it

Then create two public caller functions in `index.ts` to demonstrate scheduler functionality:

1. Create a mutation called `callerMutation` that demonstrates:
   - Takes no arguments
   - Scheduling the logging mutation to run immediately (with runAfter and 0 delay)
   - Canceling a scheduled task using the returned scheduler ID
   - Scheduling the logging action to run 10 seconds in the future using runAt
   - Returning null.

2. Create an action called `callerAction` that demonstrates:
   - Takes no arguments
   - Scheduling the logging action to run after a random delay between 0-10 seconds
   - Scheduling the logging mutation to run immediately and then canceling it
   - Returning null.

All scheduled tasks should call the logging functions with the message "Hello, world!".
