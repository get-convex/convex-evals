Create a cron job demo for Convex that demonstrates all available scheduling patterns.

Start by implementing a single `emptyAction` internal action in `crons.ts` that takes
in an optional `scheduleDescription` string, logs it to the console, and returns null.

Call this action every second using the `interval` syntax and omitting the argument.
Label this cron job "run every second".

Next, call this action every minute using the `interval` syntax.
Label this cron job "run every minute", and pass that in as an argument.

Next, call this action every hour using the `interval` syntax.
Label this cron job "run every hour", and pass that in as an argument.

Finally, call this action every month on the 11th day at 1pm UTC using the `cron` syntax.
Label this cron job "run every month on the 11th day at 1pm UTC", and pass that in as an argument.
