Create a cron job demo for Convex that demonstrates all available scheduling patterns.

Start by implementing a single `emptyAction` internal action that takes in an 
optional `scheduleDescription` string and logs it to the console.

Call this action every second using the `interval` syntax and omitting the argument.
Label this cron job "run every second".

Next, call this action every minute using the `interval` syntax.
Label this cron job "run every minute", and pass that in as an argument.

Next, call this action every hour using the `interval` syntax.
Label this cron job "run every hour", and pass that in as an argument.

Next, call this action every hour at 10 minutes using the `hourly` syntax.
Label this cron job "run every hour at 10 minutes", and pass that in as an argument.

Next, call this action every day at 7:30am UTC using the `daily` syntax.
Label this cron job "run every day at 7:30am UTC", and pass that in as an argument.

Next, call this action every week on Monday at 10:17pm UTC using the `weekly` syntax.
Label this cron job "run every week on Monday at 10:17pm UTC", and pass that in as an argument.

Next, call this action every month on the 23rd day at 11:30am UTC using the `monthly` syntax.
Label this cron job "run every month on the 23rd day at 11:30am UTC", and pass that in as an argument.

Finally, call this action every month on the 11th day at 1pm UTC using the `cron` syntax.
Label this cron job "run every month on the 11th day at 1pm UTC", and pass that in as an argument.
