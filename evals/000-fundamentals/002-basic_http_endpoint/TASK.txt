Create a backend with only two HTTP routes.

1) GET `/api/hello`
   - Read the request body as text (treat missing/empty body as empty string)
   - Respond with the body text concatenated with the literal string "there"
   - Examples:
     - body: "" -> response: "there"
     - body: "hello" -> response: "hellothere"
   - Set `Content-Type: text/plain`

2) POST `/api/messages/*`
   - Return HTTP 200 with an empty response body
   - This route should match any path under `/api/messages/` (e.g. `/api/messages/123`). In Convex, use a wildcard route (e.g. `pathPrefix: "/api/messages/"`).
