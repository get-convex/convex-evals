Write a backend that has six empty functions in `index.ts`:

1. A public query called `emptyPublicQuery`.
2. A public mutation called `emptyPublicMutation`.
3. A public action called `emptyPublicAction`.
4. A private query called `emptyPrivateQuery`.
5. A private mutation called `emptyPrivateMutation`.
6. A private action called `emptyPrivateAction`.

All six of these functions take in no arguments and return null.
