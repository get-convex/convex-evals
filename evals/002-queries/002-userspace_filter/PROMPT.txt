Given this schema:

```typescript
export default defineSchema({
  messages: defineTable({
    author: v.string(),
    text: v.string(),
    likes: v.number(),
    isPinned: v.boolean(),
  }).index("by_author", ["author"]),
});
```

Write a query named `getPopularPinnedMessages` that:
- Takes an author name and a minimum likes threshold as arguments
- Loads all of the messages by the author into memory.
- Filters IN JAVASCRIPT (not in the database) to find messages that are:
  * Pinned (isPinned === true)
  * Have at least the minimum number of likes
- Returns the filtered messages sorted by likes in descending order
