Create a backend that finds teams with deleted admins using async iteration.

1. Create this schema in `convex/schema.ts`:
```ts
import { defineSchema, defineTable } from "convex/server";
import { v } from "convex/values";

export default defineSchema({
  teams: defineTable({
    name: v.string(),
    adminId: v.id("users"),
  }),

  users: defineTable({
    name: v.string(),
    deleted: v.boolean(),
  }),
});
```

2. Create a query `getTeamsWithDeletedAdmins` in `convex/index.ts` that:
   - Takes no arguments
   - Uses an async iterator to loop through all teams, checking if the admin user is deleted
   - Returns an array of team IDs that match the criteria.

The implementation should focus on efficient database access patterns and proper
handling of large result sets through async iteration.

Only generate the `getTeamsWithDeletedAdmins` function in `convex/index.ts`. Do not generate any other functions.
Also generate the `package.json` and `convex/schema.ts` files.
