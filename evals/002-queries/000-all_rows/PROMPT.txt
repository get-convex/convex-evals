Given this schema:

```typescript
export default defineSchema({
  products: defineTable({
    name: v.string(),
    price: v.number(),
    inStock: v.boolean(),
  }),
});
```

Write two functions:

1. A mutation named `insertProducts` that inserts at least 3 different products into the table.

2. A query named `getAllProducts` that returns all products in the table.

Your solution should:
- Use proper Convex types and patterns
- Return all fields for each product
- Handle the case where the table is empty
