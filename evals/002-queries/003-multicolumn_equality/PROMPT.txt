Given this schema:

```typescript
export default defineSchema({
  tasks: defineTable({
    projectId: v.string(),
    status: v.string(),
    priority: v.number(),
    title: v.string(),
    assignee: v.string(),
  }).index("by_project_status_priority", ["projectId", "status", "priority"]),
});
```

Write a query named `getProjectTasksByStatus` that:
- Takes projectId and status as arguments
- Efficiently finds all tasks with the given projectId and status
- Efficiently sorts the results in ascending priority order
- Efficiently takes at most five results
