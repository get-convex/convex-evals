Assuming this schema:

```typescript
export default defineSchema({
  comments: defineTable({
    postId: v.string(),
    author: v.string(),
    text: v.string(),
  }).index("by_post", ["postId"]),
});
```

Write a query named `getPostComments` that:
- Takes a postId as an argument
- Efficiently returns all comments for that post in descending creation time order
