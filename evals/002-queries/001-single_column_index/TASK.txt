Write this schema to `convex/schema.ts`:
```
import { defineSchema, defineTable } from "convex/server";
import { v } from "convex/values";

export default defineSchema({
  users: defineTable({
    email: v.string(),
    name: v.string(),
    age: v.number(),
  }).index("by_email", ["email"]),
});
```

Write a query named `getUserByEmail` in `convex/public.ts` that:
- Takes arguments:  `{ email: string }`
- Efficiently looks up the user by email
- Returns null if no user is found with that email
- Throws an error if there are multiple users with the same email
- Returns all fields for the user if found
