Create a backend function that makes HTTP requests to httpbin.org to demonstrate external API calls from Convex.

Export a single public API action `fetchFromHttpBin` in `convex/index.ts` that:
   - Takes no arguments
   - Makes a GET request to https://httpbin.org/get using the global `fetch` API
   - Parses the JSON response
   - Returns the parsed response data as any, with any necessary `// eslint-disable-next-line` directives like:
     // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-assignment
    // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-return

Notes:
- No schema is required since this demo doesn't interact with the database

Only create the `package.json` and `convex/index.ts` files. Do not generate any other files.
