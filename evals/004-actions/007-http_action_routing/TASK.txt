Create a backend that implements three HTTP endpoints with different methods.

Implement these HTTP handlers in `convex/http.ts`:

1. Create a GET endpoint `/getFoo` that:
2. Create a POST endpoint `/postBar` that:
3. Create a PUT endpoint `/putBaz` that:
4. Create a GET handler for all paths under `/api/*` that:

They should all return a JSON response: `{ ok: true }` and only accept the specified methods (reject other methods with 404). Non-existent paths should return 404.

Also create a query `getSiteURL` that takes no arguments (empty object `{}`) and returns `process.env.CONVEX_SITE_URL!`.
This will require the @types/node npm dev dependency.

Create only the `convex/http.ts` and `package.json` files. Do not generate any other files.
No schema is required since this demo doesn't use the database.
