Create a backend that receives HTTP requests and stores the request body content in Convex storage.

Implement these functions in `convex/http.ts`:

1. Create an HTTP action `/store` that:
   - Stores the request body in Convex storage
   - Returns a JSON response containing:
     - storageId: The storage ID string
     - url: The public URL of the stored file

2. Create a query `getSiteURL` that takes no arguments and returns `process.env.CONVEX_SITE_URL!` (string)

No schema is required since this demo only uses file storage.

Create only the `convex/http.ts` and `package.json` files. Do not generate any other files.

The HTTP action should be accessible at the path `/store`.
