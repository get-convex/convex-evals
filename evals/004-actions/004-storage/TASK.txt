Create a backend that interacts with Convex file storage to write and read text files.

Implement these functions in `convex/index.ts`:

1. Create an action `writeTextToStorage` that:
   - Takes arguments:  `{ text: string }`
   - Uploads the data to Convex storage
   - Returns an object containing:
     - storageId: The storage ID
     - url: The public URL of the stored file

2. Create an action `readTextFromStorage` that:
   - Takes arguments:  `{ storageId: string }`
   - Retrieves the data from storage and returns it as a string
   - If the storageId is invalid or the file doesn't exist, throw an error

The implementation should demonstrate:
- Proper use of Convex storage APIs
- Correct text encoding/decoding

Create only the `convex/index.ts` and `package.json` files. Do not generate any other files.
No schema is required since this demo only uses file storage.

Do not export any functions from `convex/index.ts` other than `writeTextToStorage` and `readTextFromStorage`.
