Create a backend that implements streaming HTTP responses.

Implement this function in `convex/http.ts`:

1. Create an HTTP action POST at `/stream` that:
   - Takes a request body multi-line text input
   - For each line from the request body:
     - Calculate the length of that line of text
     - Send back a streaming response message with the length
   - The response format for each line should be:
     ```
     data: {"lineLength": <number>}\n\n
     ```
   - The endpoint should be accessible at `/stream`
   - Each line in the request should trigger one SSE message
   - The stream should properly close when the request ends
   - Use `string` for the type of output, adding type parameters for type safety.

Create only the `convex/http.ts` and `package.json` files. Do not generate any other files.
No schema is required since this demo doesn't use the database.

Also create a query `getSiteURL` that takes no arguments and returns `process.env.CONVEX_SITE_URL!`.
This will require the @types/node npm dev dependency.

Do not export any functions from `convex/http.ts` other than the streaming HTTP handler and the query.
