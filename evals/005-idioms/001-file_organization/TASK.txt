Create a backend that implements organized CRUD operations for users and posts using this schema in `convex/schema.ts`:

```ts
users: {
  name: string
  email: string
}
posts: {
  userId: Id<"users">
  title: string
  content: string
}
```
Posts should have an index to look up posts by userId and user by email.

Each set of operations should be organized into a separate file.
For each table, export a public function called `get`, `create`, and `destroy`.
Only the `get` and `create` functions return anything (the full document, or the id of the created document).
You don't need to specify a returns validator for any function.
