Create a backend that implements message listing functionality with a React frontend component.

Required files:
- convex/schema.ts
```ts
messages: {
  author: string,
  body: string,
}
```
No indexes are required.

- convex/messages.ts
```ts
export const getAllMessages = query({
  args: {},
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    return ctx.db.query("messages").order("desc").collect();
  }
});
```

- src/App.tsx
  - Create a React component that:
    - Uses a hook to fetch messages from `getAllMessages`
    - Handles loading state by showing "Loading..."
    - Handles empty state by showing "No messages yet"
    - Renders messages in a `<ul>` list with "author: body" in `<li>` elements.

- package.json
  Include convex and React dependencies, including typescript types.

- tsconfig.json
  - Only include `src` in the `include` field.

Don't add any message creation functionality - focus only on listing existing messages.
